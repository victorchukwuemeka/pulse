Got it 👍
No code, no examples — **just the core structure + mental map** you can keep seeing and aligning to.

Below is a **clean, minimal, future-proof write-up** of the runtime structure.

---

# PHP Runtime — Core Structure (Conceptual)

## What this is

A **runtime** is the system that:

* owns application startup
* controls lifecycle
* loads only what is needed
* stays independent of interfaces (web, CLI, workers)

This runtime is **not a framework**.
Frameworks and tools plug **into it**.

---

## 1. Core Runtime Layer (non-negotiable)

This layer must **never depend on web, CLI, or databases**.

### Responsibilities

* Boot sequence
* Module management
* Dependency wiring
* Configuration loading
* Lifecycle control

### Conceptual parts

* Kernel (or Runtime)
* Module system
* Container
* Configuration system
* Lifecycle manager

This layer is **small**, stable, and rarely changes.

---

## 2. Module Layer (everything is optional)

All features live as **modules**.

### What a module is

* A self-contained unit of behavior
* Can be enabled or disabled
* Declares what it provides
* Declares what it depends on

### Examples of modules

* Database
* Mailer
* Queue
* Scheduler
* Cache
* Logging
* Authentication

Modules **never control the app lifecycle** — the runtime does.

---

## 3. Interface Layer (adapters, not core)

Interfaces are **ways to interact with the system**.

They sit **on top of the runtime**.

### Examples

* CLI interface
* HTTP interface
* Worker / consumer interface
* Cron / scheduler interface

Interfaces:

* depend on the runtime
* depend on modules
* can be removed without breaking the core

The runtime must still make sense **without any interface**.

---

## 4. Application Layer (your logic)

This is where **business logic** lives.

### Characteristics

* Pure logic
* No HTTP assumptions
* No CLI assumptions
* Talks only to modules via contracts

This layer survives:

* web → API → worker transitions
* framework changes
* interface replacement

---

## 5. Configuration & Composition

Configuration decides:

* which modules are enabled
* how modules are wired
* which interface starts the system

This is **composition**, not execution.

Runtime reads config → runtime runs system.

---

## 6. Lifecycle Ownership (critical rule)

Only the runtime can:

* start the system
* stop the system
* control boot order
* manage shutdown

Modules:

* register
* boot
* react

They do **not** decide when the app runs.

---

## 7. Dependency Direction (never break this)

Correct direction:

```
Runtime
  ↓
Modules
  ↓
Interfaces
  ↓
Application Logic
```

Wrong direction (do not allow):

```
HTTP → Runtime
Controller → Kernel
Framework → Core
```

If this breaks, the runtime collapses into a framework.

---

## 8. Long-Term Design Principle

> The core must remain useful even if:
>
> * HTTP disappears
> * CLI disappears
> * databases change
> * frameworks die

If the core survives those changes, you built a runtime.

---

## 9. What you should “see” mentally

Not files.

Not classes.

But layers:

* **Runtime** → “How the system lives”
* **Modules** → “What the system can do”
* **Interfaces** → “How users talk to it”
* **Application** → “Why the system exists”

---

## Final Anchor

> **Frameworks solve problems.
> Runtimes survive time.**

This structure is what you keep in your head while building.
Code comes later.

When you’re ready, we can:

* freeze this into a formal spec
* map it to PHP realities
* or port the same structure to Rust

You’ve crossed into **architecture thinking** now.
